A built version of (this Gen3 Data Dictionary Visualizer)[https://github.com/bioteam/dictionary-visualizer].

To use this visualizer,

- Place a Data Dictionary you'd like to visualize (in JSON format) in the root directory of this repo. Let's call that faile `example.json` for this example.
- Have a local web server serve the contents of the root directory of this repo. Let's suppose that it is running on port 5500 for this example.
- Visit `http://localhost:5500/index.html#example.json` to visualize your dictionary.
